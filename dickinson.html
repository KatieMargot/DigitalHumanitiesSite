<body>
    <p>My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun -
        In Corners - till a Day
        The Owner passed - identified -
        And carried Me away -</p>
        <br>
        <p> And now We roam in Sovreign Woods -
            And now We hunt the Doe -
            And every time I speak for Him
            The Mountains straight reply -</p>
            <br>
            <p> And do I smile, such cordial light
                Opon the Valley glow -
                It is as a Vesuvian face
                Had let it’s pleasure through -</p>
                <br>
                <p> And when at Night - Our good Day done -
                    I guard My Master’s Head -
                    ’Tis better than the Eider Duck’s
                    Deep Pillow - to have shared -</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> To foe of His - I’m deadly foe -
                        None stir the second time -
                        On whom I lay a Yellow Eye -
                        Or an emphatic Thumb -</p>
                        <br>
                        <p> Though I than He - may longer live
                            He longer must - than I -
                            For I have but the power to kill,
                            Without - the power to die -</p>
